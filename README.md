# Background:
The challenge  was to analyze temperature trends for a new business proposal. Here we were asked to analyze weather trends for the months of June and December, in Oahu. To see if the proposed surf/ice cream shop could be functional year round. 


# Results: 
After looking at the data, from months June, and December a few things can be concluded. 
- The total temperature counts were a little off. June had a total number of 1700 temperatures to calculate the mean. But December only had 1517 total temperatures accounted for. 
- The temperature between June and December are not that much different. 74.94 degrees for the month of June. While December had an average temperature of 71.04 degrees. 
- When looking at the difference in standard of deviation between the two month there was a difference of 0.488

- Averages for June and December

# Summary:
Overall it seems that the surf shop could be functional all year around. There is not much difference in temperature. But then again it is Hawaii so not really an issue there. However, the only real difference is the wet and dry season. According to the Hawaii Tourism Authority, 2022. The wet season is from November to March, and the dry season is from April to October. That being said, the surf season is between November to March. So technically there would be an influx of business on the surf side, during the surf season. But during the off season, there might be less traffic for surfing but more for novelties like ice cream.

To further reiterate the surf season, a few more queries to illustrate the wet season weather have been attached below. Specifically for months November to March. Months in order form left to right: 11, 01, 02, 03
